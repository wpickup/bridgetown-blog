There are some excellent galleries in Sydney that focus on displaying the work of local artists and providing exhibition space.

I am sure its a labour of love for most of the gallery owners as the market is not large and the work required to mount a successful exhibition is significant.

- [Crackpot](https://www.crackpot.com.au) at Freshwater, regularly changing exhibits of local ceramics from Northern Beaches artists

- [Chinaclay](https://chinaclay.com.au/collections/ceramics) in Clovelly, combines a florist with a ceramics gallery "representing over 20 independent small batch ceramics artists"

- [Kerrie Lowe](https://kerrielowe.com) at Newtown, "specialises in contemporary ceramics and aims to show the huge diversity and high standard of work made by members of the Australian ceramics community"

- [Sabbia](https://sabbiagallery.com) in Redfern, aims to represent " Australiaâ€™s finest contemporary artists, focusing on ceramics, glass and fibre"

If in the mood to travel further afield, the [Sturt gallery](https://www.sturt.nsw.edu.au/sturt-campus/sturt-gallery) in Mittagong always has an eclectic mix of work with a focus furniture and ceramics.
