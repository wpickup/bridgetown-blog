I continue to be interested in [music](https://blog.williampickup.org/categories/#music), [alternative lifestyles]() and [technology]() which have been with me since high school in the 1970's.

Over the years I have been an [environmental activist](https://blog.williampickup.org/the-franklin-river-campaign-25-years-on/), [natural therapist]() and ended spending most of my working life in [IT](https://www.linkedin.com/in/williampickup/).

You can find my occasionally updated blog [here](https://blog.williampickup.org)
